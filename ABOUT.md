# What was to be accomplished?

Build a small POC on `.Net Core` to explore [Expedia's test API](https://offersvc.expedia.com/offers/v2/getOffers?scenario=deal-finder&page=foo&uid=foo&productType=Hotel)

# Why .Net Core?

It is the latest framework provided by **Microsoft**. It is cross-platform, powerful and enriched. In addtion to that my previous programming skills are **.Net**  which encouraged me to choose this framework.

# New skills aquired

* Explore the features of the **.Net Core** framework, it is my first experience with it.
* Explore the features of [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), especially building a **.Net** app there.
